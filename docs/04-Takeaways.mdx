# Takeaways
During the project, several aspects went exceptionally well, particularly the seamless integration with IBM products and the implementation of the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) technique. The virtual assistant was able to accurately and effectively handle user queries. We did face challenges in finding the best way to contextualize the data initially. However, after experimenting and testing different large language models and various model parameters, we were able to identify an approach that works well. The model can now understand and respond appropriately to a wide range of queries. This experience reinforced the importance of iterative testing and leveraging IBM's ecosystem to achieve a smooth and successful implementation.
