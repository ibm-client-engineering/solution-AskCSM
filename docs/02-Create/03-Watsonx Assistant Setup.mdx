## Advanced Watsonx Assistant Configuration
### Autocorrection
- To tackle typos, we leveraged watsonx assistant capability of Autocorrection.
- To enable this feature, navitate to Actions -> All items -> Created by you. Click "Global Settings" on the upper right corner.
![](./assets/watsonx-assistant-global-settings.png)
- Navigate to the Autocorrection tab and make sure the toggle is switched to on.
![](./assets/watsonx-assistant-autocorrection.png)
- **In NeuralSeek Search action, set query_text to expression `input.text`**. This will allow the autocorrected input to be passed to NeuralSeek extension. Originally, query_text was set to expression `input.original_text`, if users entered typos, the typoed text would be passed to NeuralSeek.
