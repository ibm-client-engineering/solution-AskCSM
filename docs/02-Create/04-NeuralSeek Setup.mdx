# NeuralSeek Setup

### Set Up
1. Once you've opened NeuralSeek, you'll land on the "Configure" tab. 
1. Enter the name of the company or organization that NeuralSeek will be generating answers for. Click "Next"

### KnowledgeBase Connection
1. Input Watson Discovery KnowledgeBase details. Discovery API Key and Discovery Service URL can be found on the Watson Discovery service instance page. Once you have created a project and a collection in Watson Discovery, the Discovery Project ID can be found on the integration tab under API Information. Once you fill out the KnowledgeBase Connection details, test the connection by clicking "Test". Once tested, click "Next". The button will turn green when it successfully connects to Watson Discovery.

1. For Virtual Agent Type, select "Watson Assistant Type". Click "Next". Click "Next". 


### LLM Details
In the LLM Details, you must add at least one LLM. If you choose to add multiple, NeuralSeek will load-balance across them for the selected functions that have multiple LLM's.
For API key, there are two options: SaaS and CP4D. You only need to fill out one or the other. Ensure your endpoint and project id are accurate.

In this case, we are interested in CP4D. The CP4D api key must be a base64 encoded key, and it can be found using the terminal comamnd below. You can generate 'myapikey' by clicking on the profile picture on the top right hand corner and then clicking 'Generate new key'.
```
printf "myusername:myapikey" | base64
```

You can confirm if you succeeded in connecting with your zenapikey by using the curl command below:
```
curl -H "Authorization: ZenApiKey ${TOKEN}" "https://<cpd_instance_route>/<endpoint>"
```

Credentials from watsonx.ai that you need for LLM details:
First make sure you have a project created within watsonx.ai.
- LLM Endpoint
    - Go to [WatsonX Platform](https://dataplatform.cloud.ibm.com/wx/home?context=wx)
    - Prompt Lab -> View code (Right hand side, to the right of Model) -> Copy the API endpoint after `curl`
- LLM Project ID: 
    - Go to [WatsonX Platform](https://dataplatform.cloud.ibm.com/wx/home?context=wx)
    - Projects -> Manage -> General -> Details -> Project ID

## Configuration & Tuning
Please see below for recommended settings:
- Knowledge Base Tuning:


- Answer Engineering & Preferences


- Intent Matching & Cache Configuration


- Governance & Guardrails


## Testing
-  Navigate to "Seek" tab. Test NeuralSeek with questions that are relevant to your documents, e.g. "What products or services do you offer?" You will be able to see the NeuralSeek answer with response details, metrics, and source.

![Session Turn](./assets/sessionturn.png)
Ensure to clear session turn if starting a new session by clicking on the red reset icon:

In addition to testing on NeuralSeek, we have written a script to allow testing through API for more flexibility.
We performed Pre-Processing and No OCR, No Pre-Processing and No OCR, and OCR experiments using the testing notebook.
You can and run the different experiments just by changing the Discovery collection ID and providing with the questions and expected responses as string arrays.
It uses the NeuralSeek API.
Please refer to [Testing Notebook](testing.ipynb) for detailed steps.

## UI Testing

Within the NeuralSeek UI, there is also a feature to send a batch of questions to test at once. This can be helpful for users who prefer UI tools, and returns answers in a spreadhseet format. To use this feature, navigate to the "upload test questions" section on the home page:

When submitting your batch of questions, format them using the [template](./assets/q.csv) provided before uploading them.
