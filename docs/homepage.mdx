The virtual assistant, AskCSM, serves as an innovative solution designed to handle inquiries related to Enterprise License Agreements (ELA). Instead of relying on a Customer Success Manager to answer routine questions, AskCSM virtual assistant efficiently addresses a wide range of queries, including product numbers, product families, royalty information, consumption details, etc. This not only enhances response time but also allows CSMs to focus on more complex and strategic tasks, ultimately improving customer satisfaction and operational efficiency. The assistantâ€™s ability to provide accurate and timely information ensures that clients receive consistent support, making it an invaluable tool for managing ELA-related inquiries.
