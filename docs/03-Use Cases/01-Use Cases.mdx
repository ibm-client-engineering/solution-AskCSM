# Use Cases

### 1. Product Related Questions
   - **Question and Answer using NeuralSeek RAG**: This component is designed to efficiently handle a wide range of product-related inquiries by using NeuralSeek and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) technique. Users can ask questions about various aspects of a product, such as its description, renewal part number, product family, royalty information, or consumption metrics. The solution works by first retrieving the most relevant information from the underlying knowledge base and then generating a well-structured, natural language response. This approach ensures that the assistant not only provides accurate data but does so in a way that is easy for users to understand. By integrating RAG, the system can deliver accurate and contextually relevant answers, enhancing the overall user experience and reducing the dependency on human Customer Success Managers for routine product inquiries.

### 2. Navigational Link
   - **Dynamic Links Based on User Input**: This feature dynamically generates and provides navigational links based on the user's input or query for specific information. For example, if a user asks for help finding licensing information, the virtual assistant can create a direct, clickable link that takes the user right to the relevant resource. This is particularly useful since navigating through multiple layers of information can be challenging. By offering these dynamic links, the assistant not only improves accessibility but also streamlines the user experience, enabling users to reach their desired destination quickly and effortlessly.

### 3. Current Catalog Consumption
   - **Display Information and Images of Charts**: This feature is designed to visually represent the user's current catalog consumption data. When users inquire about their consumption information—such as the deployment view of licensed products or software consumption—the assistant can display these visualizations. The images are hosted and then easily integrated with the virtual assistant for display. By presenting the information visually, users can quickly grasp the status of their consumption, allowing them to make informed decisions about usage, renewals, or any adjustments needed. This feature not only enhances the clarity of the information presented but also improves the overall user experience by making it easier to analyze and act on consumption data.
