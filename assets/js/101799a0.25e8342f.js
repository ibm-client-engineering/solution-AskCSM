Users can ask questions about various aspects of a product, such as its description, renewal part number, product family, royalty information, or consumption metrics. The solution works by first retrieving the most relevant information from the underlying knowledge base and then generating a well-structured, natural language response. This approach ensures that the assistant not only provides accurate data but does so in a way that is easy for users to understand. By integrating RAG, the system can deliver accurate and contextually relevant answers, enhancing the overall user experience and reducing the dependency on human Customer Success Managers for routine product inquiries."]}),"\n"]}),"\n",(0,t.jsx)(s.h3,{id:"2-navigational-link",children:"2.

By offering these dynamic links, the assistant not only improves accessibility but also streamlines the user experience, enabling users to reach their desired destination quickly and effortlessly."]}),"\n"]}),"\n",(0,t.jsx)(s.h3,{id:"3-current-catalog-consumption",children:"3.
